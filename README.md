# ADT Bag Delivery Service

This program implements an abstract data type bag to create a food delivery service. The ShoppingCart class implements the bag interface. In addition, the custom type, myType is used to define the elements in the bag. The program will take a customer number, item, and price as input for each item in the shopping cart. Finally, the contents of the shopping cart are output to the user.

Note: Currently, methods are used for testing the inputs and output of the program and it not set up for use with a command line interface.
